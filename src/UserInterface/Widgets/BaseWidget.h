/**
 * @brief A base class for custom QWidget-based widgets.
 *
 * The BaseWidget class serves as a base class for custom widgets and defines a common interface
 * for setting the QModelIndex associated with the widget.
 *
 * This class is intended to be subclassed to create specialized widgets with specific functionality.
 *
 * @note This class inherits from QWidget and defines a pure virtual function setIndex(),
 *       which must be implemented by subclasses to set the QModelIndex associated with the widget.
