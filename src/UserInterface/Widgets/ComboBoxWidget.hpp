 * @brief A custom widget for displaying and selecting options from a ComboBox.
 *
 * The ComboBoxWidget class extends the functionality of the BaseWidget to provide a specialized widget
 * for displaying and selecting options from a ComboBox. It initializes the model of the ComboBox based on
 * the data retrieved from a specified QModelIndex, expecting the model associated with the index to be of type PropertiesModel.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used for presenting selectable options to users in a graphical user interface.
 *
 * @note This class inherits from BaseWidget and adds functionality specific to ComboBox interaction.
